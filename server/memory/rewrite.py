"""Rule-based pre-retrieval query rewriting (design §4).

Deictic and relative-time queries ("刚才那个是什么", "what was that one I showed
you") fail under raw embedding similarity: the informative token is the deictic
noun, which matches nothing, while the actual referent sits a few turns back.
So these two recoverable cases are resolved by RULES before retrieval, never by
embedding similarity alone:

- relative-time phrases parse to a session-time window that filters (or, when
  the window is empty, leaves untouched) candidates by `session_ts`;
- a short deictic past-reference query is AUGMENTED with the most recent user
  turns, giving the embedder real content to bite on.

Everything here is a pure function and conservative by contract: anything
unrecognized passes through untouched. A wrong rewrite costs more than no
rewrite — the same skip-bias as the gate.
