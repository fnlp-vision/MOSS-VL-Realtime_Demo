"""L2 memory: multimodal vector memory for the realtime session plane.

    write   orchestrator ──enqueue──▶ MemoryWriter (thread) ──▶ MemoryStore
              user/assistant turns, deduped keyframes            rows + vectors
    match   ASR partial ──prefetch──▶ Retriever (fuse → rank → diversify → gate)
    insert  _user_turn ──▶ <recall> block prepended to the model-facing text only

Two invariants worth
restating here because breaking either is silent:

1. Retrieval is scoped to one `conversation_id`. There is no cross-session read
   path in this package.
2. Injected tokens are permanent residents of the session KV cache, so the gate
   is skip-biased; re-injection is allowed only past a post-ranking distance
   gate with a per-session copy cap (design §5).

Everything is behind `MEMORY_ENABLED` (default off) and every failure path
degrades to "no memory" rather than to a broken turn.
